  //this one was tough, I had to dig in my brain to compare the correct pairs of digits.
//first run, the lottery was only two numbers.
//second run, same issue, but reward worked.
//third run, rewards arent working after changing math.random to 1000
//fourth run, rewards arent working correctly, but lottery gen is successful
//rewards are wrong, one number match says you win 3k.
